VOTING APP. ASSIGNMENT txt file *some snapshots included in readme.md*

Commands used: 
  [] kubectl delete all --all;
  [] cd $home
  [] yum install git -y
  [] git clone  https://github.com/ashishrpandey/example-voting-app
  [] kubectl apply -f .

Did observe that Nodeport is assigned for voting and result pods. (Screenshot included in README.md) 

RESULT APP stopped working because it is the DB-POD that stores all the value(votes). So when DB-POD is stopped/deleted the RESULT APP wont function.

To make the RESULT-POD work again, just have to re-deploy the DB-POD. 

Some Jargons:
  - Cluster
  - Container
  - Pod
  - Service
  - Kubelet
  - Ingress
  - Deployement
